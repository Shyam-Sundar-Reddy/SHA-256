 🖧 The web app allows users to enter plain text into a text box, and the app will generate a SHA 256 hash for the text. The user can then copy the hash and use it for various applications such as verifying the integrity of a file or securely storing passwords.

The app also provides a simple interface for users to compare their plain text and the Sha 256 hash. This way, users can easily verify that the plain text they entered matches the hash generated by the app.

The app is open source and can be downloaded from GitHub. We welcome contributions from the community and encourage developers to contribute to the project.
